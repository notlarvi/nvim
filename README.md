# larv's new updated neovim config

> [!WARNING]
> This config is not portable, and probably won't work out of the box

## Took major inspirations from:
- https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua/
- https://lsp-zero.netlify.app/v3.x/blog/you-might-not-need-lsp-zero.html

## Plugins I'm no longer using:
- [telescope-file-browser](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-file-browser.nvim)
    netrw pretty much does the same thing but is a bit more ugly
- [nvim-jdtls](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls)
    Use [nvim-java](https://github.com/nvim-java/nvim-java) instead, much painless :)
