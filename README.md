# larv's new updated (personal) neovim config


# Requirements (so i don't forget)
- make sure to have all the base-devel build-essentials installed
- ~luarocks because without it telescope fails to install~

## Plugins I'm no longer using:
- [telescope-file-browser](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope-file-browser.nvim)
>    netrw pretty much does the same thing but is a bit more ugly
- [nvim-jdtls](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-jdtls)
>    Use [nvim-java](https://github.com/nvim-java/nvim-java) instead, much painless :)
>   >   Nvm nvim-jdtls is better for java
